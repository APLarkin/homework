I could not get the file (even in its stock, completely unaltered form) to work correctly on any of the testbeds I normally use for these purposes. On the TryIt Editor, it would call out that "the file requested does not exist", while others either went blank or called out a different error. That being said, however, I believe that my logic is correct and my JS should be in more or less the right ballpark for implementing all of the functionality proscribed in the homework description.
